This project is a simplified NoSQL database built using MongoDB to store and retrieve data about players and matches from the 2023 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament. The objective was to design, populate, and interact with a MongoDB database containing structured football data such as player profiles, match results, and scores.

The project demonstrates core concepts in distributed databases including database design, data population, querying, and basic UI development.
